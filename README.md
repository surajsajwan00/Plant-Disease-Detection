#Automated Plant Disease Detection for Precision Agriculture

#Overview
This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and classifying plant diseases using image analysis techniques. Leveraging deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this system helps farmers and agricultural professionals in early disease detection, enabling timely interventions to mitigate crop losses and enhance agricultural productivity.

#Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop an automated system capable of accurately detecting and classifying plant diseases using image analysis techniques. By leveraging deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in early disease detection, enabling timely interventions to mitigate crop losses and enhance agricultural productivity.

#Technologies Used
Deep Learning: VGG16 architecture for image classification.
Python: The core programming language used for development.
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras.
Streamlit: A Python library for creating the user interface.
Data: Kaggle "Plant Leaves Disease Dataset" with over 70,000 images.

#System Architecture
The system comprises the following components:
Data Acquisition and Preprocessing Module: Collects and preprocesses image data.
Model Development and Training Module: Builds and trains the VGG16 model.
Disease Detection and Classification Module: Predicts diseases from input images.
User Interface Module: Streamlit-based UI for interacting with the model.
Deployment Module: (Future integration) For deploying the system to a production environment.
